Camera-Management-System

Using MongoDB as database and Spring Boot as the framework to create the backend,
will create a simple API to display information on the cameras located in the database.
You can add new cameras, remove, modify and display cameras based on specifications using this API.
The cameras will have an Id, a name, a model, a resolution and an IP.
Also in order to interact with this API you also build the front part in Angular.

Required technologies:

FrontEnd: Angular
BackEnd: Spring Boot
